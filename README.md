## TripAdvisor Hotel Review Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to explore the relationship between TripAdvisor reviews and corresponding ratings. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, we analyze text data to understand its correlation with ratings.

### Dataset
* **Description:** TripAdvisor dataset containing hotel reviews and ratings.
* **Preprocessing:** Text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction were performed.

### Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Utilized word clouds, pie charts, bar charts, and joint plots to visualize data distribution and potential correlations.
2. **Model Development:** Implemented various machine learning models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn to predict ratings based on review text.
3. **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

### Libraries
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch
* scikit-learn
* NLTK
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* pandas

### Findings
The analysis revealed a limited correlation between TripAdvisor reviews and ratings. While reviews provide valuable insights, they are insufficient for accurately predicting ratings. Factors beyond textual content significantly influence rating assignments.

### Future Work
* Explore advanced NLP techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis).
* Incorporate additional features (e.g., hotel amenities, location).
* Investigate other datasets for comparison.
